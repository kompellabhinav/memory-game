Submitted by: **Abhinav Kompella**

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [X] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can select to length of the pattern anywhere between 6 and 12 to change the difficulty level
- [X] User can choose the number of buttons in the game anywhere between 3 and 8 to change the difficulty level
- [X] User can change the speed of the pattern to make the game easier or more difficult.
- [X] The page reloads itself automatically after every game so that a new pattern can be generated in the next game.
- [X] Buttons and text under game settings display information about it when user hovers over it.
- [X] User loses three seconds in game time if a wrong button is pressed.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The pre-work assignment helped me learn many new things, especially in JavaScript. The required features were easy because all the code was already given. I already knew HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript beforehand, so it took 90 minutes to build it. The challenge was making optional features. It took a lot of time to research and found the best way to execute the plan I had in my mind. It took me the most time to find the correct attribute type for the input element. I was only used to buttons or text fields until now, but they did not seem like the right fit for the idea I had in my mind. I had tried checkboxes and radio before I got the perfect fit which was range. I had the help of w3schools and MDN web docs for this. The next challenge was to display the selected range each time to range is slid. This took a lot of trial and error methods and the help of the developer's best friend, Stack overflow. After successfully using one range input, creating and adding functionality to the second range input did not take too long. Another dissiculty was implementing the game timer. It was easy to start the timer but it was hard to stop/pause the game timer after the user inputs his sequence. I used stackoverflow again for this and tried placing clear interval method in different places until it finally worked. This whole process took about 2 hours. I used these same websites to research ways to execute my ideas into working functions. The entire other optional steps took nearly 6 hours to finish. I feel very confident about the program after completing the pre-work project.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have heard a lot about different frameworks that help develop websites quickly. I wanted to use any of those for the pre-work assignment, but they were pretty unclear, and there was not enough time to perfect them and use them in a real-time project. I wanted to know how those frameworks can be used to make web development more fun and more straightforward. This program offers to teach node.js, react.js, express.js and MongoDB. I am looking forward to implementing those in a project. Another thing I always wanted to know is how to make a fully functional website. Everything from front-end, back-end, hosting websites to making users create accounts on the websites and using them. There are a few of the questions I would like to find answers to in this program.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would refactor the code in both CSS and JavaScript if I had more time and knowledge. I feel refactoring is essential because it will reduce the file size and make the code loo clear to anyone looking at the code. Refactoring the code would also eliminate the redundant lines of code and help the pages load much faster. Another thing I wanted to do was add keyboard listeners for the game buttons. I have eight-game buttons to which I wanted to assign 1-8 number buttons from the keyboard. If you press button 1 on the keyboard, the first game button will play. The same thing will be repeated for all eight game buttons. That way, the user can use the keyboard instead of the mouse to play this game. If I had more time to work on the pre-work assignment, I would have figured out how to implement this on the website. I was also not succesful in adding audio files to the game buttons. If i had more time I am sure I could have figured out a way to make it work]
